Patchwork is an SPRX module that patches the LittleBigPlanet series of games
to fix some of the many security vulnerabilities the games have.

## Current Fixes

Currently, the only fix is changing the XXTea encryption key used for network packets,
this fixes the force-join exploit by making it impossible to join/be joined by a player
without having the same lobby password. Additionally it allows you to patch
the game's URL, and digest key.

## Future Fixes

The ideal patches for something like this are as follows:

1. A real fix for force-join, this could come in the form of 
   validating a list of users that have had invites sent to them,
   and rejecting all users not on that list.

2. A fix for P2P script syncing, as this is the biggest threat to the online security
   of LittleBigPlanet
    

## Building

Patchwork has a couple of dependencies:

- The official PS3 SDK. Version 4.75 is recommended, but others can probably be used.
- A working version of `make`. This can generally be any build of `make`, but in the case of Windows, MSYS2 MINGW64's `make` is known to work.
- `scetool` is required for signing, if desired

Once you've got everything set up, it should just be as easy as running `make` in the project directory, which should build an SPRX.

The CI pipeline should be a clearer example of how to do this.

## Installation

As mentioned previously, the easiest and most recommended way of installing or configuring Patchwork is via
[Refresher](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresher/releases/latest).
The following instructions are intended for advanced users only.

Note that Refresher can still be used to install Patchwork with your own build. Just put your `patchwork.sprx` file next to the Refresher executable
and Refresher should say 'Found custom patchwork.sprx next to exe, uploading that instead` when (re)patching.

The game's EBOOT needs to be patched to allow it to load the SPRX.
[SPRXPatcher](https://github.com/NotNite/SPRXPatcher) is a tool that enables this quite well.

Once you've patched your EBOOT, all you need to do is put the SPRX file in the same place you specified when running SPRXPatcher.
Generally, this location should be `/dev_hdd0/plugins/patchwork.sprx` but you can put it elsewhere if desired.

Optionally, put a `patchwork_lobby_password.txt` in `/dev_hdd0/tmp` if you'd like to play with friends.
You can also use `patchwork_url.txt` and `patchwork_digest.txt` to patch to a custom server of your choice.

If you don't specify a password file, the library will randomly generate a random password on boot to ensure safety 
(effectively disabling multiplayer).
